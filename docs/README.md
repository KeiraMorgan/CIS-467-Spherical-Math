Spherical Easel is an interactive [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) application for exploring spherical geometry. (TODO: throughout this paragraph add hyperlinks to the appropriate section) This application allows users to draw, label, and control the behavior of spherical [lines](/tools/basic.html#line), [line segments](/tools/basic.html#line-segment), [circles](/tools/basic.html#circle), [conics](/tools/conic.html), [polygons](/tools/basic.html#polygon-too-hard), and custom user defined [parametric curves](/tools/advanced.html#parametric-curve-user-defined) on the unit sphere. Using constructions (including [intersections](/tools/construction.html#intersection), [bisections](/tools/construction.html#angle-bisector), [tangents](/tools/construction.html#tangent), [perpendiculars](/tools/construction.html#perpendicular), and others), measurements (including [distance](/tools/measurement.html#disance), [length](/tools/measurement.html#length), [angle](/tools/measurement.html#angle), [user defined](/userguide/#left-bottom-region-tools-objects-panel) and others), and transformations (including [isometries](/tools/transformation.html) and [inversion](/tools/transformation.html#create-inversion)) users can create precise geometric arrangements and numerically confirm conjectures in spherical geometry. In addition to being able to customize the look and feel of the displayed objects, users have the ability to load, save, export their arrangements (EPS, SVG, TikZ, animated GIFs) and import certain hand-created arrangements. If a user registers they will have the ability to create a URL to a server-side saved construction that can be publicly shared and to create a URL that points to a version of the application where the they can control which tools are available (intended primarily for instructors).

This documentation has two major parts: a [User Manual](userguide/index.md) explaining many of the features of the application available to the user and a [Design Document](design/index.md) explaining many of the choices we made while coding this application.

Spherical Easel is written in Typescript. This application is open source and use of it is granted under the \*\*\* TODO: license. This is our code on GitLab: TODO insert URL. We welcome your help in making this application better and more universally accessible.

You can help by...

- Helping to translate this program into another language (TODO: add a link)
- Reporting a bug (TODO: add a link)
- Requesting a feature (TODO: add a link)
- Adding a lesson plan to our [repository](lessonplans/) to help students learn about spherical geometry (TODO: add a link)
- Updating these help pages with rewrites or more description
- Contacting us with a question (TODO: create a sphericalEasel@gvsu.edu email and link here - put a forward on this account to the three of us?)

We hope you enjoy our app!
