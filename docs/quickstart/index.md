# Explore Equilateral Triangles

In the spirit of Euclid, we will guide the user through the steps to

- Construct a spherical equilateral triangle with common
  side length $a$ and angle $A$.
- Adjust the display style of the triangle and its location on the sphere.
- Numerically confirm the relationship $\tan(\frac{a}{2})^2 = 1 - 2 \cos(A)$.
- Add scripts to parts of the triangle so that one of the vertices is displayed only when $\angle A \geq \frac{\pi}{2}$ and the color of one of the sides of the triangle changes color depending on its length (i.e. $a$).

::: tip Mouse Events
Through out this documentation, **mouse press** (or **mouse down**) is the action of pressing the mouse button down at a location, **mouse release** (or **mouse up**) is the action of releasing the button at a location, **clicking** is the action of mouse press and mouse release at the same location, and **mouse dragging** or **dragging** or **clicking and dragging** is the action of mouse press at one location and mouse release at a different location.
