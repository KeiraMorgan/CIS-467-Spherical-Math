# Adjust the Style and Display

## 7. Use the Rotate Tool

Activate the Rotate Tool (TOOD:AddIconImage) and then mouse press and drag on the sphere to move your construction around on the sphere. You can rotate your construction repeatedly by releasing and clicking and dragging again. Drag your construction to the back of the sphere. Notice that when your construction is on the back of the sphere it is displayed in a slightly different style, you can adjust this the front style and back style behavior using the next step.

## 8. Adjust the Style and Labels: Points

By either right clicking on any vertex of the triangle and selecting settings from the menu, or by activating the Objects tab (TODO:AddIconImagine) and clicking on the three vertical dots at the end of the row containing the information about any one of the points or by clicking the Settings Icon (TODO:AddIconImage) in the upper right corner of the Sphere Canvas, activate the Style Panel. The Style Panel should appear on the right side of the application window and contain several tabs. Each of the tabs allows you to adjust certain features of the selected object, in this case the point that is the focus (the one you selected). Notice that their are options for adjusting the front and back styles either automatically using the global contrast variable or manually. See if you can change the label of one of the points to $A$ and display it.

::: tip
You can use [$\LaTeX$](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) to typeset your captions and labels by enclosing the appropriate $\LaTeX$ command or symbol code in dollar signs ($).  So $A$ is entered as \$A\$, $\theta$ as \$\theta\$, and $E= \frac{mc^2}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$ as \$E = \frac{mc^2}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\$.

## 9. Adjust the Style and Labels: Line Segments

To change the object that the Style Panel is focused on, merely leave the Style Panel open and click on the object either in the Sphere Canvas or on the corresponding row in the Objects tab. See if you can change the style of the line segments to red and thickened and then label the line segment across from point $A$ as $a$.

TODO:Include a image of the results of this.

::: tip
To close the Style Panel, click the (TODO:AddIconImage) icon in the upper right hand corner.
