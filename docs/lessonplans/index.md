# Introduction

Spherical Easel is designed for both researchers exploring and students learning spherical geometry. You can help students at all levels learn about this geometry by designing an engaging and challenge activity and posting it here. As you design I ask that you follow the format given in the introductory example below/ or template. These activities can be written in text or markdown[^1] (or [$\LaTeX$](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) by using and sharing with us (on the submission form!) an [overleaf document](https://www.overleaf.com/)) and submitted through the following link(TODO: Add link to Google Form). The authors will review your submission and, if necessary, work with you to improve it and potentially include it here.

Required elements of a lesson:

- Descriptive Title and Overview (three or four sentence)
- Target Learners (Introductory, Intermediate, Advanced)
- Approximate Length
- Key/Solution
- Teachers Guide?
- Activity
