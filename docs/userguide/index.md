# User Manual Overview

Spherical easel allows users to TODO:Copy and paste the text from the [home](/) page here once it is finalized.

All objects are created on the surface of the sphere. The basic objects are defined as follows:

- A sphere is the set of **points** a unit distance from the origin in Euclidean three space.
- A **line** is the intersection of a plane containing the center of the sphere and the surface of the sphere.
- A **line segment** is the continuous one-to-one (but not onto) image of an interval to a line.
- A **circle** is the intersection of a plane not containing the center of the sphere and the surface of the sphere. A circle of radius $R$ is also the collection of points that are $R$ away from a center point over the surface of the sphere. As the sphere is a unit sphere, a distance of $R$ on the surface corresponds to an angle of $R$ subtended at the center of the sphere.
- An **ellipse** with two (non-antipodal) foci is the set of points where the sum of the distances to each focus is constant.

The Spherical Easel window is divide into several regions: [Title Bar](/userguide/titlebar.html), [Tools & Objects Panel](/userguide/toolsobjectspanel.html), [Sphere Canvas](/userguide/spherecanvas.html), and [Style Panel](/userguide/stylepanel.html). The Style Panel is hidden initially and can be made visible by clicking on the Style Settings (TODO:AddIconImage) icon that appears in the upper right-hand corner of the Sphere Canvas (unless the user has changed the tools displayed). The functionality of each region is described below.
